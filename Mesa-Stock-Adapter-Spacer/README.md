# Mesa Stock Adapter Spacer for Remington 7615/7600

The Mesa Tactical stock adapter is a common sight for 7615/7600 rifles in countries where AR15 type rifles are harder to find. However, as the stock adapter was primarily intended for shotguns (like the 870), there is an issue with spacing/clearance when installing it on a 7615/7600. Commonly, owners just cut out whatever material is available to them to act as a spacer.

This model available to 3D print or machine, provides a more refined option to act as a spacer.
