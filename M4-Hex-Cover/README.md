# M4 Hex Cover

IKEA sometimes uses M4 countersunk hex bolts in the assembly process of their furniture ([EXPEDIT/KALLAX][1] for example). However, these bolts are still visible after assembly, and can be easily seen depending on how you orient and place it. 

This 3D model available to print, is a simple cover to prevent the screw heads from contrasting (being an eyesore) too much with the rest of the furniture. 

The colour is dependent on your filament obviously, but you can play around with it to find fun contrasts to suit your decor or simply just match it.

**NOTE**: I'm not to sure whether IKEA uses M5 or bigger/smaller hex screws for their furniture, but this design should be adapted easily by simply scaling it.


## Install / Assembly Instructions

The "stem" that fits in the screw head is sized a bit larger as it is **friction fit** into place (so you don't use glue), it shouldn't just slip in. Therefore, it's recommended that you use a rubber mallet or just a regular hammer with some cloth (to prevent damaging your furniture) to *persuade* it into place. 

## Print Settings
**Resolution**: 200 microns/0.2mm (can go smaller)

**Infill**: 100%

**Supports**: No

**Rafts/Brim**: No

## Removal / Accidents Happen

If you require access to the screw to disassemble the furniture or the "head" of the cover snaps off for whatever reason, them remaining stem can be removed. I've "developed" a method to remove it.

To remove the stuck stem, I heated a thin metal object (such as a small screw driver) that could be inserted into the plastic and bed itself in it - at and angle helps. You can then simply pry/pull the plastic without damaging the screw and the finish furniture.
