#3D Printing

This repository contains files for my 3D printing projects.

Full write-ups can be found on my website providing further information on the projects/prints, detailing assembly and print instructions where necessary.

#### Contents

The files should contain:

- .stl for slicing
- README.md containing printing details for slicers
- .scad/solidworks/fusion files if available
- Pictures/videos of the completed prints

## Personal Setup

These prints were either printed (unless specified elsewhere) on my [Printrbot Simple Metal][1] or [RepRap][2]. 

The filament I'm printing with is PLA from [Bilby 3D][5] unless it's an exotic filament, which will be noted in the printing details/summary.

My Printrbot is hooked up with a Raspberry Pi 2 running the excellent [OctoPrint][3] host software. You can view a livestream of the printer at: [print.thinh.com.au][4] (it's more of a PowerPoint presentation with my internet connection - gcode view is the closest to 'live')
